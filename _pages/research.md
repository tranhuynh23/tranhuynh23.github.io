Local Newspaper Closures and Discrimination in Mortgage Lending
---------
[Job Market Paper]

Draft coming soon

Description: I investigate how local newspaper closures affect discrimination against minority borrowers in the US mortgage lending market. A long line of literature has found that with similar credit scores and loan attributes, black and Hispanic loan applicants are more likely to be rejected or to pay higher interest rates than white applicants. I depart from the literature by examining how shocks to local media coverage (e.g., the closure of local newspapers) affect such discrimination. Recent research shows that local newspapers effectively monitor corporate fraud and mitigate information frictions in public lending. Based on existing evidence, I hypothesize that a decline in local media coverage will likely exacerbate the interest rate gap between minority and non-minority borrowers.

[Financial Literacy and Mortgage Payment Delinquency](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/zdyojgf0iatrcv26ecqvj/20231030_FLPaper.pdf?rlkey=17jriew91fphhkfegn8i5sq9h&dl=0)

Abstract: More than a decade after the Great Recession hit the US economy, the US mortgage delinquency rate remains above pre-crisis levels. While adverse life events are undoubtedly the primary cause of delinquency, theory and existing empirical evidence suggest that a lack of basic financial literacy also helps explain this undesirable behaviour. However, it has been challenging to identify the causal effect of financial literacy on mortgage delinquency, in part because financial literacy is measured with error and there is insufficient data to make a clear identification. In this study, I implement various instrumental variable (IV) strategies to investigate such an effect. As expected, I find that increased financial literacy significantly reduces the probability of mortgage delinquency. The identified causal effect is robust to different specifications of the IV and cannot be explained by formal education, income, age, or gender. Interestingly, overconfidence in one's own financial literacy increases the probability of delinquency. Meanwhile, there is no evidence that strategic default incentives affect the results. In addition, I examine the heterogeneity of the above effects across different demographic groups. I find that the effects of financial literacy and overconfidence on mortgage delinquency are significantly different from zero for any age, gender, income, or education level. However, the magnitude of the effect decreases monotonically with age and is higher in states with low levels of financial literacy than in states with high levels of financial literacy.

[Early Warning Models for Systemic Banking Crises: Can Political Indicators Improve Prediction?](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vx6ajogds2cut9hrthhph/20230908_EWSPaper.pdf?rlkey=q2eoyxphx3val8vplobiyo4vq&dl=0)

Abstract: This study provides a novel attempt to assess whether an early warning system (EWS) for systemic banking crises can produce better predictions when political indicators are used alongside traditional macro-financial indicators. Based on a dataset covering 32 advanced economies for the period 1975-2017, we show that the inclusion of political indicators significantly improves the predictive performance of the model. Our results suggest several channels, related to the role of constitutions and policy predictability, through which the political environment could affect the stability of a banking system. In particular, we find that majority governments, left-wing governments, and a longer time in office of the executive party are negatively correlated with systemic risk. This is robust to a large number of different specifications. Furthermore, we find that long-established institutional systems and plurality electoral systems (compared to proportional representation systems) are associated with a lower likelihood of crises. At the same time, crises are more likely when the incumbent government represents a nationalist platform.
