Lending in the Dark: Local Newspaper Closures and Discrimination in Mortgage Lending
---------
[Job Market Paper]

Description: I examine how local newspaper closures affect discrimination against minority borrowers in the US mortgage lending market. A long line of literature has found that, despite similar credit scores and loan characteristics, black and Hispanic applicants are more likely to be denied loans or pay higher interest rates than white applicants. I depart from the literature by examining how shocks to local media coverage (e.g., the closure of local newspapers) affect such discrimination. Recent research shows that local newspapers effectively monitor corporate fraud and mitigate information frictions in lending. Based on the existing evidence, I hypothesize that a decline in local media coverage will likely exacerbate the interest rate gap between minority and non-minority borrowers in mortgage lending.

[Financial Literacy and Mortgage Payment Delinquency](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4770596)

SSRN 4770596

Abstract:  Financial literacy plays an increasingly important role in determining various economic and financial outcomes. This paper examines the causal effect of financial literacy on mortgage delinquency. Using various instrumental variable (IV) strategies, I find that increased financial literacy significantly reduces mortgage delinquency. This effect cannot be explained by adverse life events, negative equity, and many individual characteristics. In addition, I show that overconfidence is positively correlated with the probability of delinquency. For overconfident individuals, the negative effect of financial literacy on mortgage delinquency is more than double the effect for those who are not overconfident. These findings have important implications for policy and research on the role of financial literacy and overconfidence in personal finance.

[Early Warning Models for Systemic Banking Crises: Can Political Indicators Improve Prediction?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268023001283?via%3Dihub)

Abstract: This study provides a novel attempt to assess whether an early warning system (EWS) for systemic banking crises can produce better predictions when political indicators are used alongside traditional macro-financial indicators. Based on a dataset covering 32 advanced economies for the period 1975-2017, we show that the inclusion of political indicators significantly improves the predictive performance of the model. Our results suggest several channels, related to the role of constitutions and policy predictability, through which the political environment could affect the stability of a banking system. In particular, we find that majority governments, left-wing governments, and a longer time in office of the executive party are negatively correlated with systemic risk. This is robust to a large number of different specifications. Furthermore, we find that long-established institutional systems and plurality electoral systems (compared to proportional representation systems) are associated with a lower likelihood of crises. At the same time, crises are more likely when the incumbent government represents a nationalist platform.
