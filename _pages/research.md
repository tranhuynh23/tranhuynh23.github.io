Local Newspaper Closures and Discrimination in Mortgage Lending
---------
[Job Market Paper]

Description: I examine how local newspaper closures affect discrimination against minority borrowers in the US mortgage lending market. A long line of literature has found that, despite similar credit scores and loan characteristics, black and Hispanic applicants are more likely to be denied loans or pay higher interest rates than white applicants. I depart from the literature by examining how shocks to local media coverage (e.g., the closure of local newspapers) affect such discrimination. Recent research shows that local newspapers effectively monitor corporate fraud and mitigate information frictions in public lending. Based on the existing evidence, I hypothesize that a decline in local media coverage is likely to exacerbate the interest rate gap between minority and non-minority borrowers observed in mortgage lending.

Abstract: Almost two decades after the Great Recession hit the US economy, the US mortgage delinquency rate remains above pre-crisis levels. While adverse life events and negative equity are widely considered to be the primary causes of delinquency, theory and existing empirical evidence suggest that a lack of basic financial literacy also helps explain this undesirable behaviour. However, it has been difficult to identify the causal effect of financial literacy on mortgage delinquency because financial literacy is measured with error and there is insufficient data for a clean identification. In this study, I implement various instrumental variable (IV) strategies to investigate such an effect. The primary dataset is constructed from the representative NFCS data on financial knowledge and financial behaviour of US adults, together with several complementary data for the IV instruments from prestigious US institutions and related literature. As expected, I find that increased financial literacy significantly reduces the probability of mortgage delinquency. The identified causal effect is robust to different specifications of the IV and cannot be explained by individual demographic characteristics (e.g. age, gender, income, education, etc.), negative income shocks, or strategic default incentives. Interestingly, overconfidence is positively correlated with the probability of delinquency. As a result, the negative effect of financial literacy on mortgage delinquency is significantly larger for the overconfident group than for the non-overconfident group. However, while this negative effect remains stable over the life cycle for the non-overconfident group, it decreases monotonically with age for the overconfident group.

[Early Warning Models for Systemic Banking Crises: Can Political Indicators Improve Prediction?](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vx6ajogds2cut9hrthhph/20230908_EWSPaper.pdf?rlkey=q2eoyxphx3val8vplobiyo4vq&dl=0)

Abstract: This study provides a novel attempt to assess whether an early warning system (EWS) for systemic banking crises can produce better predictions when political indicators are used alongside traditional macro-financial indicators. Based on a dataset covering 32 advanced economies for the period 1975-2017, we show that the inclusion of political indicators significantly improves the predictive performance of the model. Our results suggest several channels, related to the role of constitutions and policy predictability, through which the political environment could affect the stability of a banking system. In particular, we find that majority governments, left-wing governments, and a longer time in office of the executive party are negatively correlated with systemic risk. This is robust to a large number of different specifications. Furthermore, we find that long-established institutional systems and plurality electoral systems (compared to proportional representation systems) are associated with a lower likelihood of crises. At the same time, crises are more likely when the incumbent government represents a nationalist platform.
