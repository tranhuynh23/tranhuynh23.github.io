Welcome! I am a Career Development Fellow in the Department of Finance at [Durham University Business School](https://www.durham.ac.uk/business/). 

My research focuses on financial intermediation, banking, and household finance, with a particular emphasis on how information frictions, regulatory frameworks, and technological change shape credit markets and financial outcomes. I am also interested in the intersections of politics, history, and contemporary economic challenges.
