Welcome! I am a Career Development Fellow in the Department of Finance at [Durham University Business School](https://www.durham.ac.uk/business/). 

My research focuses on financial economics and empirical banking, with a particular emphasis on mortgage markets — including regulation, lending practices, and household borrowing and repayment behavior. I am also interested in the intersections of politics, history, and contemporary economic challenges. 

You can find my CV [here](https://tranhuynh23.github.io/files/CV_Tran_Huynh.pdf).
