Welcome! I am a Career Development Fellow in Finance at [Durham University Business School](https://www.durham.ac.uk/business/). 

My primary research interests are in financial economics and empirical banking, with a strong focus on mortgage markets, including their regulation, lending practices, borrowing and debt repayment behaviour. I am also interested in politics and history and their relationship to contemporary economic issues.

You can find my CV [here](https://tranhuynh23.github.io/files/CV_Tran_Huynh.pdf).
