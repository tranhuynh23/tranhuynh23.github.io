Welcome! I am a PhD student in Economics at [Friedrich Schiller University Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de/en). 

My primary research interests are in financial economics and empirical banking, with a strong focus on the mortgage market and its related regulations, practices, and behaviours. I am also interested in politics, history, and their relation to contemporary economic issues.

You can find my CV [here](https://tranhuynh23.github.io/files/CV_Tran_Huynh.pdf).
