I am a PhD student in Economics at Friedrich Schiller University Jena. 

My main research interests are in financial economics and empirical banking, with a strong focus on the mortgage market and the social impacts of its related regulations, practices, and behaviours. I am also interested in politics, history, and their relation to contemporary economic issues.

You can find my [CV] (https://tranhuynh23.github.io/files/CV_Tran_Huynh.pdf) here.
